# INET 2005 - Lab 4D

This repository begins empty.

You will add code to this by completing the in-class lecture steps for the React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial in class sessions where you work along with the instructor.

Lab 4D builds upon the in-class work and asks you to add additional functionality beyond the work that you did in class.

Refer to the Lab4D document and accompanying class recordings for more information.
